# 📦 Installation

1. Extract the plugin to your Redmine plugins folder:
   ```bash
   cd {REDMINE_ROOT}/plugins/
   git clone https://github.com/haru/redmine_ai_helper.git
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   bundle install
   ```

3. Run database migrations:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:migrate RAILS_ENV=production
   ```

4. Restart Redmine:


# ⚙️ Basic Configuration

## Plugin Settings

1. Open the AI Helper settings page from the Administration menu.
2. Create a model profile and fill in the following fields:
   - Type: Choose the AI model type (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic. Strongly recommend using OpenAI)
   - Name: Enter a name for the model profile
   - Access Key: Enter the API key for the AI service
   - Model name: Specify the AI model name (e.g., gpt-4.1-mini)
   - Temperature: Set the temperature for the AI model (e.g., 0.7)
3. Select the model profile you created from the dropdown menu and save the settings.


## Role and Permission Settings

1. Go to "Roles and permissions" in the administration menu
2. Configure the AI Helper permissions for each role as needed

## Project-specific Settings

1. Open the settings page for each project where you want to use the plugin
2. Go to the "Modules" tab
3. Enable "AI Helper" by checking the box
4. Click "Save" to apply the changes

# ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

## MCP Server Settings

The "Model Context Protocol (MCP)" is an open standard protocol proposed by Anthropic that allows AI models to interact with external systems such as files, databases, tools, and APIs.
Reference: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers

The AI Helper Plugin can use the MCP Server to perform tasks, such as sending issue summaries to Slack.

1. Create `config/ai_helper/config.json` under the root directory of Redmine.
2. Configure the MCP server as follows (example for Slack and GitHub):
   ```json
   {
      "mcpServers": {
         "slack": {
            "command": "npx",
            "args": [
            "-y",
            "@modelcontextprotocol/server-slack"
            ],
            "env": {
            "SLACK_BOT_TOKEN": "xoxb-your-bot-token",
            "SLACK_TEAM_ID": "T01234567"
            }
         },
         "github": {
            "url": "https://api.githubcopilot.com/mcp/",
            "authorization_token": "Bearer github_pat_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
        },
      }
   }
   ```
3. Restart Redmine.

## Vector Search Settings

Configure settings to perform vector searches for issues using Qdrant.
With this configuration, the AI Helper Plugin can use Qdrant to perform vector searches on Redmine issues and wiki data.

### Qdrant Setup

Here is an example configuration using Docker Compose.

```yaml:docker-compose.yml
services:
   qdrant:
      image: qdrant/qdrant
      ports:
         - 6333:6333
      volumes:
         - ./storage:/qdrant/storage
```

### Creating the Index

Run the following command to create the index.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:vector:generate RAILS_ENV=production
```

Registers ticket data into the index. The initial run may take some time.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:vector:regist RAILS_ENV=production
```

Please execute the above commands periodically using cron or a similar tool to reflect ticket updates.

This completes the configuration.

### Recreating the Index

If you change the embedding model, delete the index and recreate it using the following commands.

```bash
bundle exec rake redmine:plugins:ai_helper:vector:destroy RAILS_ENV=production
```

# 🛠️ Build your own Agent

The AI Helper plugin adopts a multi-agent model. You can create your own agent and integrate it into the AI Helper plugin.

To create your own agent, you need to create the following two files:

- **Agent Implementation**
   - A class that inherits from `RedmineAiHelper::BaseAgent`
   - Defines the agent's behavior
- **Tools**
   - A class that inherits from `RedmineAiHelper::BaseTools`
   - Implements the tools used by the agent

Place these files in any location within Redmine and load them.

As an example, there is a plugin called `redmine_fortune` under the `example` directory. Place this plugin in the `plugins` folder of Redmine. This will add a fortune-telling feature to the AI Helper plugin. When you ask, "Tell me my fortune for today," it will return a fortune-telling result.

# 🪄 Langfuse integration
By integrating with Langfuse, you can track the usage of the AI Helper Plugin. This allows you to monitor the cost of LLM queries and improve prompts effectively.


![Image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/35904911-db39-4da7-baf6-a90fe05d9115)

To configure the integration, add the following to `{REDMINE_ROOT}/config/ai_helper/config.yml`:

```yaml
langfuse:
  public_key: "pk-lf-************"
  secret_key: "sk-lf-************"
  endpoint: https://us.cloud.langfuse.com # Change this to match your environment
```

# ⚠️ Important Notice
